    <h1>Report:</h1>

    <p>
        Is the content original, not placeholder text or copy lifted from elsewhere?
        <br>
        My site is not text-heavy, but the parts that do have text were written by me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Does the site incorporate a form element?
        <br>
        The "artifacts" and "characters" pages both have form elements for the radio button selectors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Does the site include links to other sites?
        <br>
        The home page has link to more helpful resources. The hunt pages have links to more in-depth write ups from a redditor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Are there the required five separate pages?
        <br>
        There are 6 separate pages and the report page (7th).
    </p>

    <p>
        Does the page include a favicon?
        <br>
        It is a blue box with "E7P" in it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Does the page include an animation?
        <br>
        The nav bar has hover color changes and click color changes. The "Hunts" part brings down a dropdown menu. The mobile site has hover on the burger which also brings down a menu.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Is a report.html included that summarizes how the project requirements were met?
        <br>
        You are here now (hopefully).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Are the images appropriate to the theme?
        <br>
        Images are from the game it is themed after.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Are the images appropriately sized?
        <br>
        In my testing on 2 monitor sizes and in mobile mode yes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Are there strong axes of alignment?
        <br>
        Everything is justified left or centered based on what I felt looked better and what made it line up best.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Is your style maintained across pages?
        <br>
        Same style similar to mono column across each page.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Is the spacing clean?
        <br>
        To me, yes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Does the site include different fonts?
        <br>
        Main header has a unique font. Most of the font is standard sans-serif with bodies of text being serif.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Is the site designed with the client in mind rather than the designer?
        <br>
        I made it with ease of use in mind and have positive feedback on the straightforwardness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Does your site appear appropriately on both mobile and desktop screens?
        <br>
        In my testing on 2 different screen sizes and browser resizing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Is your site arranged in a navigable way?
        <br>
        Clear navigation bar on top with links to each page. Mobile has a clear icon containing a dropdown with links.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Are images made accessible with alt attributes?
        <br>
        With how many images I had to write alt attributes for, I hope so.
    </p>

    <p>
        Are external CSS files used?
        <br>
        Yes. No internal style sheet used.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is the site organized into folders as specified?
        <br>
        All in the "css" folder.
    </p>

    <p>
        Are classes and IDs used appropriately to apply styles at the right level of granularity?
        <br>
        The classes and IDs I used were the easiest way for me to style what I want. So to me, yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Are selectors used appropriately?
        <br>
        I hope so. Like the last one, it doesn't seem like this one is up to me to decide.
    </p>

    <p>
        Are lowercase filenames used?
        <br>
        All filenames are lowercase.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is the site served over HTTPS on port 443?
        <br>
        Check.
    </p>

    <p>
        Does port 80 redirect to port 443?
        <br>
        Check.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript readable?
        <br>
        To me, yes, but I also wrote it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Does your HTML and CSS pass all validation?
        <br>
        All files were put through the Nu Validator and returned no errors or warnings.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is the site created without the aid of other libraries or frameworks?
        <br>
        Check.
    </p>

    <p>
        Was there a steady flow of commits to Git?
        <br>
        Steady commits over the span of the project. Definitely more commits in the last week of the project, but that is expected.
    </p>
